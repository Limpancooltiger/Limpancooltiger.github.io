            <h3>My passion for engineering</h3>
            <p class="paragraphLight">I've been interested in engineering for as long as I can remember and I have a need to know how things work. It propably started with Legos. There was something special about creating something new and finding solutions to problems. When I were ten years old I started to play games on my parents computer and my mind was blown. I had to understand how that metalbox worked. So since then I've had a great interest for everything that is related to computers. I'm not sure where and when I developed my passion for cars and motorcycles but this has led me to mechancial engineering.</p>

            <li><p>Powerlifting</p><p class="paragraphLight">This is my main hobby, I've been working out reguraly for three years and there is no better feeling than going to the gym and lift a heavy weight that you couldn't do last month. This hobby keeps my head clear, makes sure I have routines, eat healty and of course keeps my body in shape.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learning</p><p class="paragraphLight">I would say that learning is a hobby of mine since I like to spend time learning on the internet through tutorials and finding inspiration. Which is how i made this website for example.</p></li>
            <li><p>Motorcycles</p><p class="paragraphLight">I love the freedom of riding motorcycles, but the most fun I have is when I'm tinkering in the garage and getting dirty. That is why I have a Honda CB400N from 1984 which I'm preparing to make into a café racer.</p></li>
            <li><p>Guitar</p><p class="paragraphLight">Been playing for a few years and it's alot of fun to play some riffs and a good way to clear my mind.</p></li>
