            <h3>My passion for engineering</h3>
            <p class="paragraphLight">I've had a fascination with engineering for as long as I can remember. It all began with those childhood days playing with Legos. There was something truly captivating about building things from scratch and trying to understand how they functioned.Then, when I was about ten years old, I started playing computer games on my parents' computer, and my curiosity for software and IT began. I couldn't help but explore the inner workings of that metal box. Somewhere I've also grown a passion for cars and motorcycles, the exact moment it ignited remains a bit of a mystery. Nonetheless, these interests have naturally led me to pursue a path in mechanical engineering, particularly focusing on product development and design.</p>

            <li><p>Powerlifting</p><p class="paragraphLight">This is my main hobby I've been hitting the gym consistently for three years, and nothing beats the satisfaction of lifting a heavy weight that was out of reach just a month ago. It's not just about staying in shape; this hobby keeps me grounded, sets up regular routines, ensures I eat well, and, of course, keeps my physique in check. It's a holistic pursuit that's become a vital part of my life.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learning</p><p class="paragraphLight">I'd consider learning as one of my hobbies since I genuinely enjoy investing time in acquiring new knowledge and finding inspiration. With some searches on the internet I was able to put togheter this website for instance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Motorcycles</p><p class="paragraphLight">I really enjoy the sense of freedom that comes with riding motorcycles, but what truly gets me excited is working in the garage and getting my hands dirty. That's why I've got a 1984 Honda CB400N that I'm getting ready to turn into a café racer.</p></li>
