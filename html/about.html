            <h3>My passion for engineering</h3>
            <p class="paragraphLight">I've been interested in engineering as long as i can remember and I have a need to know how things work. It propably started with Legos. There was something special about creating something new and finding solutions to problems. When I were ten years old I started to play games on my parents computer and my mind was blown. I had to understand how that metalbox worked. So since then I've had a great interest for everything that is related to computer. I'm not sure where and when I developed my passion for cars and motorcycles but this has led me to mechancial engineering.</p>
