            <p>Project Overview</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">During my last year at Jönköping University we had a course where we collaborated with the company Husqvarna. I worked in a group of six students and was tasked to either improve a current product or to create a new product for Husqvarna, with the goal of improving the working conditions for green space professionals.</p>

            <p>My Contributions</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">This project was done in school so we didn't divide the group in term of roles beacuse everyone wanted a chance to try different things and learn. So I was part in the whole proccess from gathering information for the market study to creating the working prototypes.</p>

            <p>Summary of the project</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">This project started with a single question which was "How can we improve the working conditions through products or services for green space professionals". So with this minimal information we found a problem on the market and created a solution. Finally we presented this for Husqvarna at an exhibition which was livestream at LinkedIn</p>

            <p>What our group did</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">During the market research we found that extended use with backpack leaf blowers can result in elbow and shoulder pain. So we improved the ergonomics of Husqvarnas current leaf blower by adjusting the handle to a more comfortable position. We also developed an optimized hook to remove the load from the arm and distribute it over greater muscle groups.‍</p>

            <p>What I learned</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">The main thing that I learned from this project was the importance of a well informed market research. You can come up with ideas that might seem good, but dosen't have any application in the real world. So to develop ideas that actually fufills a purpouse and is desired on the market a good understanding is needed, this comes from the market research.</p>
