            <p>Project Overview</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">During the second year at Jönköping University they have a course called NFK, which means that we do an internship at a company that we find.‍ I did my Internship at Combitech with eight other engineering students and together we created a hexapod robot that is remotely controlled by an android application.</p>

            <p>My Contributions</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">Togheter with two other mechanical engineering students I design and created the prototype. The prototype is made by laser-cut plastic sheets and standard components. To do this I used Solidworks and alot of work in the workshop.</p>

            <p>What I learned</p>
            <p class="paragraphLight">This project was alot of fun and I learned alot. The work was structured with SCRUM so I got to learn how that work process is used. Beacuse we where both mechanical, software and embeded engineers I learned how important it is with good communication. Fortunately I have done some programming and electrical work prior to this as hobbies, so I could understands what they were doing. This made it easy for me to create a design which took their criterias in conciderations.</p>
