          <p class="paragraphLight">Through my education, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of product development and design from a mechanical engineering perspective. This learning has equipped me with both theoretical insights and practical skills. I've become proficient in designing market studies and crafting well-founded problem descriptions. The ultimate goal is to develop products that not only meet real-world needs but also find a niche in the market, and I've learned how to navigate this entire process effectively.</p>

          <p class="paragraphLight">The natural path for me was to pursue a technological education during my time in high school, or "gymnasiet" as we call it. I initially enrolled at Erik Dahlbergsgymnasiet with a focus on information and media, which provided me with a solid foundation in computer fundamentals, including programming, web development, and hardware. However, I didn't quite find my place at that school, so for my final year, I made the switch to Bäckadal. This institution had a more pronounced emphasis on mechanical engineering, and it was there that I quickly developed a passion for computer-aided design (CAD) and hands-on work. Consequently, I made the decision to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering at Jönköping University.</p>
